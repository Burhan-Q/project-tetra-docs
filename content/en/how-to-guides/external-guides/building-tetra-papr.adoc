== Quick Synopsis

This guide will walk you through how to build a PAPR.  It assumes that you have some knowledge of soldering, 3D-printing, and cutting foam with a knife using a stencil, or that you're willing to learn, as the steps are fairly bsaic.  In the end, you will have three things: a box with a filter and a fan in it, a second box with batteries and a fan controller, and a mask.  These three things will be connected by hoses, wires, and straps, and you'll have something that will protect you and those around you from breathing COVID-19 or any other airborne virus transmitted through breathing, coughing, etc.  

Please note that this system will not protect you from anything landing in your eyes.  For that protection, either the mask will need to be modified to be a helmet, or you will need a face shield.

== Introduction

Now, in the time of COVID-19, many people are at risk for exposure to the virus and cannot afford to get infected.  These people can isolate themselves, but often, their professions or requirements for daily life will take them in contact with other people, and they need some form of protection.  Masks definitely help, but can become uncomfortable to wear, and also obscure the face of the wearer.  This guide will walk you through creating a Powered Air-Purifying Respirator, which will protect the wearer and those around them from airborne viruses and bacteria, while at the same time providing positive airflow to the wearer's face.  That airflow makes sure that the wearer has a supply of fresh, cooled, clean air that has gone through a filtration process, and, in our tests, is the equivalent of wearing an N99 mask.

The core of the idea is fairly simple: put a fan behind a filter in an airtight box, have the fan pull air through the filter, and push that air through a hose.  The hose goes to a mask on the wearer's face.  The wearer then breathes out, and air travels through a second hose back into the box and back out through the same filter.  This system means that the wearer only needs one filter for both inhalation and exhalation.  The wearer is protected from their surroundings, and anyone in the surroundings is protected from the wearer, both by the same filter.  The filter itself lasts for 3 months or so, while the battery is rechargeable for repeated use.

== 3D Printed Parts

You will need to print, using an FDM printer, PLA resin, at 0.2mm spacing:

== Necessary Tools

You will need these tools:

1.  A crimper
2.  Needlenose pliers
3.  A soldering iron, solder, & some way to hold a part to be soldered
4.  A hex screwdriver for the m4 screws
5.  Tin snips
6.  An x-acto knife
7.  A 3D printer capable of printing all of the listed components (note the size of the print bed for the fan box)
8.  A deburring tool
9.  A small Phillips head screwdriver for the screw connections on the fan controller board

== Building the Battery/Controller Box

We start by building the battery controller box.  You will need these components on hand:

1.  Battery Case ("M12 Controller Body")
2.  Battery lid ("M12 Lid")
3.  Crimper
4.  Needle-nose pliers
5.  Soldering iron/solder/soldering tools
6.  2 red jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
7.  2 black jacketed stranded wire ~2-3 inches (7-10 cm) long
8.  Heat Shrink (to protect wire connections)
9.  2 Male Spade Quick Splice Crimp Terminals
10.  Tin snips
11.  Wire stripper
12.  Deburring tool

## Build Steps

### Prepare the wires

#### Cut the wires to size.

To do so, you will need to cut them down to their lengths (our build used ~3 inch/10 cm lengths).  We prepared all six wires (4 stranded and 2 solid) to be basically the same dimensions: ~3 inches/~10 in length, 0.5 cm insulation stripped from both ends.

#### Tin the stranded wires.  

Follow this guide here:

### M12 controller circuitry 

#### Snip a portion of the spade connector
A video describing this step:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-bJ9DFfB/0/1920/i-bJ9DFfB-1920.mp4[]

#### Clean the M12 battery holder spade ports
On the inside of the printed M12 box, there are two slots where the spade connector should fit in.  These slots may have some extra plastic around them due to print quality issues, so use an x-acto knife to clean those slots:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-V6kxqFR/0/1920/i-V6kxqFR-1920.mp4[]

#### Insert the spade connectors into the M12 box
These spade connectors should be inserted with red on the left, black on the right.  The snipped connector should slide in place and prevent the spade connector from coming back out again.

#### Install the board into the M12 box

This video captures the entire process:
video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fHTTM3s/0/1920/i-fHTTM3s-1920.mp4[]

Essentially, these steps are followed:

1.  Remove the knob and nut from the control board
2.  Install the power plug into the box
3.  Connect the knob and spade power wires to the board (red to plus, black to minus, spades to DC in and power plug to motor control)
4.  Place the board in the box
5.  Screw the nut and motor control knob onto the board from the outside of the box
6.  Check the connection by turning on the power knob and looking for the red LED on the board to light up
6.  Close access to the circuitboard using the M12 Lid

You may need to deburr the edges of the hole:

Congratulations, you have completed the assembly of the power box for your PAPR!


== Building the Fan Box

The fan box is assembled in such a way that different regions of the HEPA filter are used for the inspiratory and expiratory air pathways, and uses foam, dryer tape, and weather sealing to ensure the separation between chambers.

### Install the fan, funnel, and power

#### Install the power socket

This socket will allow the guitar cable to connect the fan box to the power box so that the knob on the power box can control the fan.  Inserting the socket is fairly straightforward, and is explained in this video:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ZP5x4Hh/0/1920/i-ZP5x4Hh-1920.mp4[]

#### Connect the fan to the power cable. 

Insert the red wire into the side fan connector where the red cable enters the connector, and the black wire into the black side of the fan connector.  You can test by plugging the guitar cable into the power socket and into the fan socket; turning the knob should power the fan.


#### Install the funnel and fan in the box

Place the dryer tape around the junction between the fan and the funnel, and then slide the complex into the hole into the fan box.  Once the complex is snapped in place, wrap the rest of the tape around the junction between the fan and the funnel.

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-ZWcDgSs/0/1920/i-ZWcDgSs-1920.mp4[]

#### Test that the fan blows

Connect the guitar cable between the M12 power box and the fan box.  The knob should control the fan and allow for variable blower settings, and air should not be coming out of any part of the system except one side of the funnel.

### Install the foam and weather stripping

#### Use the stencils to cut foam inserts

There are three foam inserts, and two have stencils in this build that are 3d printable.  Cutting the foam follows the procedure outlined in this video:

video::https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-8pkKGjH/0/1920/i-8pkKGjH-1920.mp4[]

#### After the foam is cut, punch holes for the screws

The purpose of this step is to allow screws to connect the fan holder box to the filter holder box and not twist the foam insert.

### Install the filter and the top grill



== Attaching to the Mask


== Care and Maintenance

Filter swaps every 3 months

Battery charge as necessary

Cleaning the exhalation line of condensed water

== Alternative designs

You can create a version of this with no egress tube, but instead have an egress one-way valve on the mask.  This approach will mean that those around you are not protected, but avoids the problem of water building up in the exhalation line.

You can create a design using a mask fitment device, as in this guide: <guide>  However, you will compromise your mask, and that may mean less protection for you.  You will also have to replace the mask as frequently as if you did not have your PAPR in place.

For both of these designs, the dual funnel from the fan box can be replaced with a single-funnel variant.
